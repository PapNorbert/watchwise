Another dreamer who came to Atlantic City decades ago is Lou Pascal, who has long worked as a numbers runner and who claims to have been a cellmate and thus implied confidante of Bugsy Siegel. Although Lou still dresses to the standard to which he is accustomed, his dream long died as he only works penny ante stuff for Fred, most of his current income from being the kept man of widowed recluse, Grace Pinza.

Jean Valjean, a galley slave who was sent to prison for stealing food, is now released after serving nineteen years. At first he only encounter mistrust and closed doors; only the saintly Bishop Bienvenu treats him kindly and takes him in. The bishop's truly Christian compassion and humanity not only restores Jean Valjean's faith in the good, but also smoothes his way back to an orderly life. As Monsieur Madeleine, Valjean is soon a wealthy industrialist and popular citizen, even becoming the mayor of a small provincial town. His good fortune departs, however, when he meets Fantine, one of his workers, an unmarried mother who tragically dies of consumption. The well-intentioned Valjean frees Fantine's illegitimate daughter Cosette from the clutches of her insidious foster parents, and looks after her like a father. When Valjean reveals his true identity in order to prevent an innocent man who closely resembles him from being sold into a life of slavery as a result of a police error, he is convicted yet again. Valjean soon succeeds in escaping yet again, however, and manages to live under a false name in Paris for a few years. When Cosette, now a young lady, falls in love with the young attorney Marius Pontmercy, Valjean forbids the match - because he has fallen in love with the young girl himself... At this point, however, Marius finds out about Valjean's disreputable past and about Valjean's love for her and has no choice but to keep him away from Cosette. Valjean, thinking of his former benefactor Bishop Bienvenu, now makes the ultimate sacrifice - he decides to do without Cosette. A short while later Valjean falls seriously ill, but in the face of death he leaves a message of love to the young couple: \"There is only one thing in the world that is important - and that is to love each other.\" Drama, Romance N/A G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Christian Clavier, John Malkovich", "label": 0.77}, {"text1": "Seducing Doctor Lewis Ste-Marie-La-Mauderne is a small, depressed coastal village in Qu\u00e9bec, where even fishing as an industry has died.

Although not stating it as one of those failings, he also speaks about the sexual abuse of minors, both girls and boys, in his role as a priest, where his victims number in the hundreds covering approximately two decades in Central California, with his youngest known victim being nine months old. He admits that he spent as much time planning his abuses, which included gaining the confidences of parents sometimes also in sexual means, than he did with actual ministering. A handful of his victims and their support networks speak of how the abuse was able to happen, how it has negatively affected their collective lives to this day (while Father Ollie walks seemingly happy a free man in his native Ireland), and how they are trying to regain their faith in a holistic manner. Experts talk about how items specific to the Catholic religious structure institutionalize such abuse where power rests in the hands of a small few, while the flock - the masses - are meant, as good Catholics, to be subservient to that power, and why the abuse of girls is treated differently by the church than that of boys. This documentary then opens up the discussion to the fact that clergy abuse within the Catholic church is not isolated only to Father Ollie, but is widespread, may be institutionalized psychologically, and efforts are still made at almost every step by those in positions of power, including the Pope, to protect the abusers at the expense of the victims. In Father Ollie's case, he was moved from parish to parish within his diocese (the Los Angeles Diocese) and often promoted, while his victims were told he would be moved not only into therapy but into positions where children could no longer be abused.

Yes some moments can be repetitive, but I still enjoyed it regardless, and even as a kid I was so taken with the characters and writing than to care about what material was repeated. The characters are at least engaging, Felix may be annoying to some but not to me, he does have a high pitched voice but he is a funny, likable and endearing character. Although he is the main character, the supporting characters were better, the Professor was hilarious and I loved the villains especially Master Cylinder.

This job is somewhat ironic as she purportedly aborted a pregnancy when she was seventeen, nineteen years ago. Her stepfather urged her to go through with the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption, he, now dead, the only person in her personal life who knew that she went through with it. She is approached by Nicky, an aspiring filmmaker, who has proof of her son's identity, said son who threw such information away in no longer wanting to contact her. As his application for a scholarship to the AFI, Nicky wants to make a film on Mamie \"discovering\" her son. Not wanting to have her story splashed across a movie screen, especially as the biological father is still in her life and doesn't know, while wanting to know the identity of her son which Nicky won't divulge unless she agrees to the documentary, Mamie enlists the help of her masseuse boyfriend, Mexican immigrant Javier, to throw Nicky off the track of her plan of stealing the information from him while helping him with his AFI scholarship submission. Mamie, Nicky and Javier's lives may take a turn as documentaries often take on a life of their own. In story two, Charley, Mamie's stepbrother, who is the biological father of Mamie's child from a very brief sexual relationship they had after her mother and his father married, has grown up to realize his homosexual orientation. Managing the last existing of the chain restaurants he and Mamie inherited from their father, Charley is in a long term relationship with Gil, an architect. They are best friends with Gil's friend from high school, Pam, and her current partner, Diane. Pam and Diane had once asked Gil to be the sperm donor to artificially inseminate Pam, but ultimately they decided to use sperm from a bank instead that resulted in their now two year old son, Max. Sharing his belief with Gil but not the extent to which he is going, Charley is convinced that Pam and Diane did end up using Gil's sperm to father Max without telling them, he going on a quest to discover proof.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.

She learns of Vince's true business as a gangster when she walks in on him killing one of his employees who wronged him. As a witness to the murder, Deloris goes on the run to the police, Lieutenant Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn), who has long been running an operation to get enough evidence to put Vince behind bars, this murder, which could be the metaphorical nail in Vince's coffin. However, Vince has put a contract out on Deloris' life to prevent her from testifying against him. As such, Eddie has to hide her until the trial, which will be at least two months. Where Eddie chooses is St. Katherine's, a poor Catholic parish and convent in a tough neighborhood in San Francisco. The convent's Mother Superior (Dame Maggie Smith) reluctantly takes Deloris in, that reluctance as Deloris is not anywhere near being close to looking or acting like a typical nun. Furthermore, the Mother Superior does not tell any of the sisters Deloris' true identity or the real reason for her being at St. Katherine's. With the Mother Superior cloistering the sisters behind the convent walls to pray for the salvation mostly of down and out of the neighborhood while keeping the sisters safe from harms of the outside world, there is an immediate and continual clash of wills between her and Deloris. Deloris, as renamed Sister Mary Clarence, does have an effect on two of the sisters, Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy), a perpetually perky woman, and Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena), who always feels left behind in whatever is happening in life. The clash between Deloris and the Mother Superior leads to the Mother Superior restricting Deloris to one task at the convent, one that leads to good and bad changes at St. Katherine's, the bad most specifically in potentially leading Vince and his associates to Deloris. Those changes also bring the battle of wills between Deloris and Mother Superior to a head, unless each can see the positive in what is happening in relation to their life at the convent.

The unlikely nature of their relationship is due to their fundamental differences, where she is Jewish and passionate about her political activism both in political freedoms and Marxism to an extreme where she takes life a little too seriously, while he is the golden boy WASP, being afforded the privileges in life because of his background but who on the most part is able to capitalize on those privileges. Their lives are shown in four general time periods, in chronological order when they attend the same college, their time in New York City during WWII, his life as a Hollywood screenwriter post-war, and his life as a writer for a New York based live television show. It is during college that Hubbell finds his voice in life as a writer, and that Katie sees beyond his good looks to find a person with substance who realizes his position in a life as something that does not give him an inherent right to those opportunities. External world events, such as the Spanish Civil War, WWII and the House Un-American Activities investigation, do affect their lives directly, but it is how they deal with these effects personally, largely in relation to personal relationships - such as with Hubbell's long term friends J.J. and Carol Ann, the latter his college girlfriend - that may dictate if Katie and Hubbell are able to make it in the long term as a couple.

Bill's short-term living situation in Christine's sitting room is despite her solely wanting a female roommate. Soon thereafter, Bill meets Steve Davis (Jim Hutton), an athlete with the American Olympic team who seems to be reluctant to disclose in which event he is competing. Like Bill, Steve has arrived in Tokyo two days early of his scheduled arrival, has nowhere to stay for those two days, and without Christine's knowledge also wrangles his way into Christine's flat to share her sitting room with Bill as Bill sublets half of the sitting room to Steve. Christine is reluctant to tell anyone of her new roommates because of the perceived impropriety. Those not in the know include her fianc\u00e9 of twenty-two months, Julius D. Haversack (Sir John Standing), the Second Secretary to the Minister of Protocol at the British Embassy. Bill, who has met Mr. Haversack, considers him to be officious and obnoxious. Despite Christine being in a relationship with Mr. Haversack, she and Steve gradually fall for each other. Seeing what is happening between Christine and Steve, Bill does whatever he can to push the two together and to get Mr. Haversack out of the way. When the truth comes out about the roommate situation, Bill sees a different opportunity for Christine and Steve's joint happiness.

Captain Albert Wiles, who stumbles across the body and finds by the man's identification that his name is Harry Worp, believes he accidentally shot Harry dead while he was hunting rabbits. Captain Wiles wants to hide the body as he feels it is an easier way to deal with the situation than tell the authorities. While Captain Wiles is in the adjacent forest, he sees other people stumble across Harry, most of whom don't seem to know him or care or notice that he's dead. One person who does see Captain Wiles there is spinster Ivy Gravely, who vows to keep the Captain's secret about Harry. Captain Wiles also secretly sees a young single mother, Jennifer Rogers, who is the one person who does seem to know Harry and seems happy that he's dead. Later, another person who stumbles across both Harry and Captain Wiles is struggling artist Sam Marlowe, to whom Captain Wiles tells the entire story of what he has seen thus far. Over the course of the day, several revelations come to light that question if Captain Wiles actually killed Harry. Sam, Mrs. Rogers, Captain Wiles and Miss Gravely's individual and collective actions in the matter of Harry take into account friendship, self-preservation, the path of least resistance, love and a lot of realizations about what their past actions will mean. Their work may all be for naught if Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs, the closest thing to law enforcement in their town, finds out about Harry.

Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

If he is asked by the clerk if he would like the meal super sized, he has to say yes. And by the end of the thirty days, he will have had to have eaten every single menu item at least once. Before starting the experiment, he is tested by three doctors - a general practitioner, a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist - who pronounce his general health to be outstanding.

Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

Regardless, famed and fastidious Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who needs to get back to London immediately, is able to secure last minute passage in the compartment with the assistance of his friend, Signor Bianchi, one of the directors of the train line who is also making the trip. Some of the first class passengers seem concerned about Poirot's presence on the train. At least one of them has reason to be concerned, as later, another first class passenger, who earlier in the trip asked Poirot to provide protection for him due to several death threats, is found murdered in his stateroom by multiple stabbings. At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to Bianchi as not to get the Yugoslav police involved. Poirot quickly learns that the victim was not who he presented himself to be and has a connection to a five-year-old American kidnapping and murder case of infant Daisy Armstrong, murdered in spite of the fact that her parents had paid the requested ransom. The murderer in that case has long been convicted and executed but the ransom moneys were never recovered, a known accomplice never captured, and both the Armstrong parents have since tragically died. As Poirot questions the train's valet, the victim's accompanying staff, and the other primarily well off first class passengers and their accompanying servants, who are all on the surface more than cooperative, he finds that many had opportunity and motive, the latter which may not be obvious. There is also a great deal of evidence discovered on the train, which pulls his thoughts in many directions. These pieces of information may complicate the deduction of who is the murderer.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love.

High school senior Carrie White is a social outcast, largely due to being unwise to the ways of the world based on her upbringing. Her mother, Margaret White, is a religious fanatic, her extreme views primarily targeted against sex, which she believes is a sin. She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to Carrie. Mrs. White's beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband Ralph long ago having run off with another woman. The only adult authority figure who tries to help Carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, Miss Collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how Mrs. White chooses to raise Carrie, Mrs. White whose beliefs are well known in the community. An impromptu event that happens among Carrie's phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. One of those students, self absorbed Chris Hargensen, vows revenge against Carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. Another student however, the popular Sue Snell, begins to feel sorry for Carrie. In wanting to help her get out of her shell, Sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. This move does not sit well with Mrs. White, who in her extreme view believes Carrie will fall prey to sin. All these competing issues lead to Carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

He agrees to stay with her and he tries to keep her happy, while hiding her true identity as a gumiho from all others by introducing her as his friend, Mi Ho. Slowly, however, he becomes less scared of her and more protective of her-finally admitting to himself and to her that he loves her. As the story unfolds, Mi Ho (Shin Min Ah) pursues her goal of becoming human, with the half-human, half-supernatural Park Dong Joo, who has a career as a veterinarian and has been living as a half-human for hundreds of years, informing her that to do so, she must drink his blood and allow a human to keep her fox bead inside their body for a full 100 days - faithfully entering into a Love Contract, and keeping the bead from being harmed by remaining chaste. However, Dong Joo does not mention that at the end of the 100 days the human will die. Mi Ho and Dae Woong fall in love without fully knowing the consequences of fulfilling her goal: namely, that Woong will die if she becomes fully human.

Son Jody (Anthony Francoisa) has no ambition and does not work, spending much of his time fooling around with his seductive wife, Eula (Lee Remick). He finds 23-year-old daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) clever, but he feels she also wastes her time on more contemplative pursuits. While most of her contemporaries are married, Clara has been dating Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson), a genteel mama's boy, for six years. Will would not mind Alan so much if he too thought Alan had a bit of a forceful man in him, which he could demonstrate by actually asking Clara to marry him. Conversely, Jody laments that nothing he does is ever good enough for his father, while Clara plain does not like the way he treats them. Into their lives comes Ben Quick (Paul Newman), who Jody hired while Will was hospitalized, to do some sharecropping on currently vacant land. Despite Will believing the unsubstantiated stories that Ben burned down someone's barn as an act of vengeance, Will becomes to view Ben as the son he never had, as he is much the same mold. As such, Will does whatever he can to get Ben to be part of the family to carry on the Varner name the way Will wants it be, which means marrying Clara. Through the process, Clara may come to a realization about what she really wants in life, while Jody does whatever he can to retain his position in the family.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

Despite her low school ranking, she still dreams of using her talents as a webtoon artist to get into Korea University to be with the boy she likes. Her best friend, Oh Sa Rang (Park Se Wan), is the daughter of the school janitor. She already knows that college is not a realistic goal for her so she already has her mind set to studying for the civil service exam. Despite having a lower ranking than Eun Ho, the moody Hyun Tae Won (Kim Jung Hyun) has a wealthy father who is an investor in the high school. So teachers look the other way in the face of Tae Won's bad behavior and poor school performance. The children of wealthy families get the best education that money can buy, with expensive study materials, private tutors and cram schools. But Song Dae Hwi (Jang Dong Yoon) is No. 1 in his class, despite being poor and having an alcoholic mother who does little to help him. He is forced to tutor other rich kids like Kim Hui Chan (Kim Hee Chan) for the money, while the beautiful Hong Nam Joo (Seol In Ah) seems to be dating him just to get his study notes. When a mysterious student starts causing trouble at the high school, Eun Ho is wrongly blamed. Can she catch the real culprit to clear her own name so that she can still strive to go to college?

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!
