Jean Valjean, a galley slave who was sent to prison for stealing food, is now released after serving nineteen years. At first he only encounter mistrust and closed doors; only the saintly Bishop Bienvenu treats him kindly and takes him in. The bishop's truly Christian compassion and humanity not only restores Jean Valjean's faith in the good, but also smoothes his way back to an orderly life. As Monsieur Madeleine, Valjean is soon a wealthy industrialist and popular citizen, even becoming the mayor of a small provincial town. His good fortune departs, however, when he meets Fantine, one of his workers, an unmarried mother who tragically dies of consumption. The well-intentioned Valjean frees Fantine's illegitimate daughter Cosette from the clutches of her insidious foster parents, and looks after her like a father. When Valjean reveals his true identity in order to prevent an innocent man who closely resembles him from being sold into a life of slavery as a result of a police error, he is convicted yet again. Valjean soon succeeds in escaping yet again, however, and manages to live under a false name in Paris for a few years. When Cosette, now a young lady, falls in love with the young attorney Marius Pontmercy, Valjean forbids the match - because he has fallen in love with the young girl himself... At this point, however, Marius finds out about Valjean's disreputable past and about Valjean's love for her and has no choice but to keep him away from Cosette. Valjean, thinking of his former benefactor Bishop Bienvenu, now makes the ultimate sacrifice - he decides to do without Cosette. A short while later Valjean falls seriously ill, but in the face of death he leaves a message of love to the young couple: \"There is only one thing in the world that is important - and that is to love each other.\" Drama, Romance N/A G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Christian Clavier, John Malkovich", "label": 0.77}, {"text1": "Seducing Doctor Lewis Ste-Marie-La-Mauderne is a small, depressed coastal village in Qu\u00e9bec, where even fishing as an industry has died.

Although not stating it as one of those failings, he also speaks about the sexual abuse of minors, both girls and boys, in his role as a priest, where his victims number in the hundreds covering approximately two decades in Central California, with his youngest known victim being nine months old. He admits that he spent as much time planning his abuses, which included gaining the confidences of parents sometimes also in sexual means, than he did with actual ministering. A handful of his victims and their support networks speak of how the abuse was able to happen, how it has negatively affected their collective lives to this day (while Father Ollie walks seemingly happy a free man in his native Ireland), and how they are trying to regain their faith in a holistic manner. Experts talk about how items specific to the Catholic religious structure institutionalize such abuse where power rests in the hands of a small few, while the flock - the masses - are meant, as good Catholics, to be subservient to that power, and why the abuse of girls is treated differently by the church than that of boys. This documentary then opens up the discussion to the fact that clergy abuse within the Catholic church is not isolated only to Father Ollie, but is widespread, may be institutionalized psychologically, and efforts are still made at almost every step by those in positions of power, including the Pope, to protect the abusers at the expense of the victims. In Father Ollie's case, he was moved from parish to parish within his diocese (the Los Angeles Diocese) and often promoted, while his victims were told he would be moved not only into therapy but into positions where children could no longer be abused.

Yes some moments can be repetitive, but I still enjoyed it regardless, and even as a kid I was so taken with the characters and writing than to care about what material was repeated. The characters are at least engaging, Felix may be annoying to some but not to me, he does have a high pitched voice but he is a funny, likable and endearing character. Although he is the main character, the supporting characters were better, the Professor was hilarious and I loved the villains especially Master Cylinder.

In story one, Mamie works as a psychologist at an abortion clinic, she, in addition to providing counseling, assessing mental fitness and thus approving or declining the request by potential patients for the procedure. This job is somewhat ironic as she purportedly aborted a pregnancy when she was seventeen, nineteen years ago. Her stepfather urged her to go through with the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption, he, now dead, the only person in her personal life who knew that she went through with it. She is approached by Nicky, an aspiring filmmaker, who has proof of her son's identity, said son who threw such information away in no longer wanting to contact her. As his application for a scholarship to the AFI, Nicky wants to make a film on Mamie \"discovering\" her son. Not wanting to have her story splashed across a movie screen, especially as the biological father is still in her life and doesn't know, while wanting to know the identity of her son which Nicky won't divulge unless she agrees to the documentary, Mamie enlists the help of her masseuse boyfriend, Mexican immigrant Javier, to throw Nicky off the track of her plan of stealing the information from him while helping him with his AFI scholarship submission. Mamie, Nicky and Javier's lives may take a turn as documentaries often take on a life of their own. In story two, Charley, Mamie's stepbrother, who is the biological father of Mamie's child from a very brief sexual relationship they had after her mother and his father married, has grown up to realize his homosexual orientation. Managing the last existing of the chain restaurants he and Mamie inherited from their father, Charley is in a long term relationship with Gil, an architect. They are best friends with Gil's friend from high school, Pam, and her current partner, Diane. Pam and Diane had once asked Gil to be the sperm donor to artificially inseminate Pam, but ultimately they decided to use sperm from a bank instead that resulted in their now two year old son, Max. Sharing his belief with Gil but not the extent to which he is going, Charley is convinced that Pam and Diane did end up using Gil's sperm to father Max without telling them, he going on a quest to discover proof.

Not the best drummer or backup vocalist, Otis' band-mates keep him in the band as his wealthy father, Frank, provides the band with many of their toys, he spreading his money easily to those in his life.

The Empress possesses a scepter which controls Izmer's Golden Dragons. To challenge her rule, Profion must have the scepter, and tricks the Council of Mages into believing Savina is unfit to hold it.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.

She learns of Vince's true business as a gangster when she walks in on him killing one of his employees who wronged him. As a witness to the murder, Deloris goes on the run to the police, Lieutenant Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn), who has long been running an operation to get enough evidence to put Vince behind bars, this murder, which could be the metaphorical nail in Vince's coffin. However, Vince has put a contract out on Deloris' life to prevent her from testifying against him. As such, Eddie has to hide her until the trial, which will be at least two months. Where Eddie chooses is St. Katherine's, a poor Catholic parish and convent in a tough neighborhood in San Francisco. The convent's Mother Superior (Dame Maggie Smith) reluctantly takes Deloris in, that reluctance as Deloris is not anywhere near being close to looking or acting like a typical nun. Furthermore, the Mother Superior does not tell any of the sisters Deloris' true identity or the real reason for her being at St. Katherine's. With the Mother Superior cloistering the sisters behind the convent walls to pray for the salvation mostly of down and out of the neighborhood while keeping the sisters safe from harms of the outside world, there is an immediate and continual clash of wills between her and Deloris. Deloris, as renamed Sister Mary Clarence, does have an effect on two of the sisters, Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy), a perpetually perky woman, and Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena), who always feels left behind in whatever is happening in life. The clash between Deloris and the Mother Superior leads to the Mother Superior restricting Deloris to one task at the convent, one that leads to good and bad changes at St. Katherine's, the bad most specifically in potentially leading Vince and his associates to Deloris. Those changes also bring the battle of wills between Deloris and Mother Superior to a head, unless each can see the positive in what is happening in relation to their life at the convent.

The unlikely nature of their relationship is due to their fundamental differences, where she is Jewish and passionate about her political activism both in political freedoms and Marxism to an extreme where she takes life a little too seriously, while he is the golden boy WASP, being afforded the privileges in life because of his background but who on the most part is able to capitalize on those privileges. Their lives are shown in four general time periods, in chronological order when they attend the same college, their time in New York City during WWII, his life as a Hollywood screenwriter post-war, and his life as a writer for a New York based live television show. It is during college that Hubbell finds his voice in life as a writer, and that Katie sees beyond his good looks to find a person with substance who realizes his position in a life as something that does not give him an inherent right to those opportunities. External world events, such as the Spanish Civil War, WWII and the House Un-American Activities investigation, do affect their lives directly, but it is how they deal with these effects personally, largely in relation to personal relationships - such as with Hubbell's long term friends J.J. and Carol Ann, the latter his college girlfriend - that may dictate if Katie and Hubbell are able to make it in the long term as a couple.

Bill's short-term living situation in Christine's sitting room is despite her solely wanting a female roommate. Soon thereafter, Bill meets Steve Davis (Jim Hutton), an athlete with the American Olympic team who seems to be reluctant to disclose in which event he is competing. Like Bill, Steve has arrived in Tokyo two days early of his scheduled arrival, has nowhere to stay for those two days, and without Christine's knowledge also wrangles his way into Christine's flat to share her sitting room with Bill as Bill sublets half of the sitting room to Steve. Christine is reluctant to tell anyone of her new roommates because of the perceived impropriety. Those not in the know include her fianc\u00e9 of twenty-two months, Julius D. Haversack (Sir John Standing), the Second Secretary to the Minister of Protocol at the British Embassy. Bill, who has met Mr. Haversack, considers him to be officious and obnoxious. Despite Christine being in a relationship with Mr. Haversack, she and Steve gradually fall for each other. Seeing what is happening between Christine and Steve, Bill does whatever he can to push the two together and to get Mr. Haversack out of the way. When the truth comes out about the roommate situation, Bill sees a different opportunity for Christine and Steve's joint happiness.

Captain Albert Wiles, who stumbles across the body and finds by the man's identification that his name is Harry Worp, believes he accidentally shot Harry dead while he was hunting rabbits. Captain Wiles wants to hide the body as he feels it is an easier way to deal with the situation than tell the authorities. While Captain Wiles is in the adjacent forest, he sees other people stumble across Harry, most of whom don't seem to know him or care or notice that he's dead. One person who does see Captain Wiles there is spinster Ivy Gravely, who vows to keep the Captain's secret about Harry. Captain Wiles also secretly sees a young single mother, Jennifer Rogers, who is the one person who does seem to know Harry and seems happy that he's dead. Later, another person who stumbles across both Harry and Captain Wiles is struggling artist Sam Marlowe, to whom Captain Wiles tells the entire story of what he has seen thus far. Over the course of the day, several revelations come to light that question if Captain Wiles actually killed Harry. Sam, Mrs. Rogers, Captain Wiles and Miss Gravely's individual and collective actions in the matter of Harry take into account friendship, self-preservation, the path of least resistance, love and a lot of realizations about what their past actions will mean. Their work may all be for naught if Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs, the closest thing to law enforcement in their town, finds out about Harry.

Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

If he is asked by the clerk if he would like the meal super sized, he has to say yes. And by the end of the thirty days, he will have had to have eaten every single menu item at least once. Before starting the experiment, he is tested by three doctors - a general practitioner, a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist - who pronounce his general health to be outstanding.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too.

Once the train departs, the one person who it is uncertain is on the train is a middle aged English governess named Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty). Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), who was vacationing in Mandrika with girlfriends before heading back to England to get married, is certain that Miss Froy was on the train as they were in the same compartment and they had tea together in the dining car, but all those people who can corroborate her story don't seem to want to do so.

As Iris and Gilbert go on their quest throughout the train, they believe there is a conspiracy amongst many of the passengers against the validity of there being a Miss Froy. But if there is a conspiracy, Iris and Gilbert still have to find Miss Froy and find out why anyone would want to kidnap a middle aged English governess.

Regardless, famed and fastidious Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who needs to get back to London immediately, is able to secure last minute passage in the compartment with the assistance of his friend, Signor Bianchi, one of the directors of the train line who is also making the trip. Some of the first class passengers seem concerned about Poirot's presence on the train. At least one of them has reason to be concerned, as later, another first class passenger, who earlier in the trip asked Poirot to provide protection for him due to several death threats, is found murdered in his stateroom by multiple stabbings. At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to Bianchi as not to get the Yugoslav police involved. Poirot quickly learns that the victim was not who he presented himself to be and has a connection to a five-year-old American kidnapping and murder case of infant Daisy Armstrong, murdered in spite of the fact that her parents had paid the requested ransom. The murderer in that case has long been convicted and executed but the ransom moneys were never recovered, a known accomplice never captured, and both the Armstrong parents have since tragically died. As Poirot questions the train's valet, the victim's accompanying staff, and the other primarily well off first class passengers and their accompanying servants, who are all on the surface more than cooperative, he finds that many had opportunity and motive, the latter which may not be obvious. There is also a great deal of evidence discovered on the train, which pulls his thoughts in many directions. These pieces of information may complicate the deduction of who is the murderer.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

High school senior Carrie White is a social outcast, largely due to being unwise to the ways of the world based on her upbringing. Her mother, Margaret White, is a religious fanatic, her extreme views primarily targeted against sex, which she believes is a sin. She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin, about which she has refused to mention to Carrie. Mrs. White's beliefs were taken to that extreme largely because of her own failed marriage and her husband Ralph long ago having run off with another woman. The only adult authority figure who tries to help Carrie with her life is her phys ed teacher, Miss Collins, who is nonetheless warned not to get too close to go against how Mrs. White chooses to raise Carrie, Mrs. White whose beliefs are well known in the community. An impromptu event that happens among Carrie's phys ed classmates against her leads to her classmates being punished. One of those students, self absorbed Chris Hargensen, vows revenge against Carrie for that punishment, the method of the revenge associated to the phys ed class incident. Another student however, the popular Sue Snell, begins to feel sorry for Carrie. In wanting to help her get out of her shell, Sue asks her boyfriend, the equally popular Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the senior prom instead of her. This move does not sit well with Mrs. White, who in her extreme view believes Carrie will fall prey to sin. All these competing issues lead to Carrie deciding on an impulse to use a newfound skill to free herself from the figurative chains that have long been placed around her, with tragic consequences.

Leopold was being tried for the arson of the factory where he worked, and for murder for the death of the factory foreman Clyde Bracken, whose body was never recovered but who is assumed to have died in the fire. Despite the danger to herself, Nora hides Leopold since she believes his story that although he, as an activist, did speak out about the dangerous conditions at the factory, he did not set the fire, which he assumes was done by the factory's owner, Andrew Holmes, to collect the insurance money, all the while having Leopold as a scapegoat.

Leopold escaped if only because he knew he would not get a fair trial due to the rabble rousing being conducted by Holmes against him.

Nora, Leopold and Leopold's lawyer, Sam Yates, try to get Lightcap involved in helping Leopold by showing him that Leopold indeed will not get a fair trial.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

Kogarashi has no desire to hurt a ghost girl, and instead he ends up agreeing to help her to figure out her unfinished business.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

The world is gray and getting quickly grayer as more and more things die off. A man and his pre-teen son, who was born after the apocalypse, are currently on the road, their plan to walk to the coast and head south where the man hopes there will be a more hospitable environment in which to live. The man has taught his son that they are the \"good people\" who have fire in their hearts, which in combination largely means that they will not resort to cannibalism to survive. The man owns a pistol with two bullets remaining, which he will use for murder/suicide of him and his son if he feels that that is a better fate for them than life in the alternative. Food and fuel are for what everyone is looking. The man has taught his son to be suspect of everyone that they may meet, these strangers who, out of desperation, may not only try to steal what they have managed to scavenge for their own survival, but may kill them as food. Although life with his father in this world is all the boy has known, he may come to his own thoughts as to what it means holistically to be one of the good or one of the bad. Meanwhile, the man occasionally has thoughts to happier times with his wife/the boy's mother before the apocalypse, as well as not as happy times with her after the apocalypse and the reason she is no longer with them.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

To him, his children are a disappointment, who he sees as not being able to carry on the Varner name in the style to which he has built around it. Son Jody (Anthony Francoisa) has no ambition and does not work, spending much of his time fooling around with his seductive wife, Eula (Lee Remick). He finds 23-year-old daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) clever, but he feels she also wastes her time on more contemplative pursuits. While most of her contemporaries are married, Clara has been dating Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson), a genteel mama's boy, for six years. Will would not mind Alan so much if he too thought Alan had a bit of a forceful man in him, which he could demonstrate by actually asking Clara to marry him. Conversely, Jody laments that nothing he does is ever good enough for his father, while Clara plain does not like the way he treats them. Into their lives comes Ben Quick (Paul Newman), who Jody hired while Will was hospitalized, to do some sharecropping on currently vacant land. Despite Will believing the unsubstantiated stories that Ben burned down someone's barn as an act of vengeance, Will becomes to view Ben as the son he never had, as he is much the same mold. As such, Will does whatever he can to get Ben to be part of the family to carry on the Varner name the way Will wants it be, which means marrying Clara.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

Kido is the granddaughter of the late Mitsumasa Kido, the man that sent Seiya to Greece, separating him from his sister Seika.

Facing an enormous mass of enemy force, mankind has developed large humanoid arms called as Tactical Surface Fighters and deployed them to its defense lines through out the world. However, all those efforts could slow down defeats but could not stop BETA, and mankind is forced to abandon major area of the Eurasian Continent. For 30 years, mankind is bogged down in an endless war against BETA without any hopes of victory. In 2001, the Imperial Japan faces difficulties in the development of a next-generation main Tactical Surface Fighters (TSF) as it defends the front lines of the Far East. The UN has proposed a joint development program between the Imperial Japan and the United States as a part of its international mutual development project of TSF, the Prominence Project. Yui Takamura, a surface pilot of the Imperial Royal Guards of Japan, is given responsibility for the project and sets off to Alaska. Meanwhile, Yuya Bridges, also a surface pilot of the US Army, was heading to the same destination. Yet they never knew that their encounter would change their destiny drastically.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

Thirteen of those house guests live in 13 different states. America will watch every single move they compete to be the last one standing, after having twelve house guests evicted.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

Too bad, but her misfortune only continues: she is evicted from her apartment, because of her father's debts. However, Nanami does not curse her misfortune. One day, she saves a good-looking young man in a park from a huge phobia he has; he is afraid of dogs. After a small talk, the young man listens to Nanami's problems and offers her to live at his place, which he abandoned 20 years ago. In addition to this, he also kisses her on the forehead to express his gratitude. It turns out that Nanami is invited to live in a God's shrine and that the young man that kissed her actually passed her the mark of the area's deity. The unfortunate girl is no longer unfortunate, but her life has not gotten any easier, too. She now should take care of her academic progress, as well as of her deity's duties.

The first actor to ever to run a film studio, Robert Evans' film career started in 1956, poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

After a glamorous--but short-lived--career as a movie star, Evans tried out producing.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

To him, his children are a disappointment, who he sees as not being able to carry on the Varner name in the style to which he has built around it. Son Jody (Anthony Francoisa) has no ambition and does not work, spending much of his time fooling around with his seductive wife, Eula (Lee Remick). He finds 23-year-old daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) clever, but he feels she also wastes her time on more contemplative pursuits. While most of her contemporaries are married, Clara has been dating Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson), a genteel mama's boy, for six years. Will would not mind Alan so much if he too thought Alan had a bit of a forceful man in him, which he could demonstrate by actually asking Clara to marry him. Conversely, Jody laments that nothing he does is ever good enough for his father, while Clara plain does not like the way he treats them. Into their lives comes Ben Quick (Paul Newman), who Jody hired while Will was hospitalized, to do some sharecropping on currently vacant land. Despite Will believing the unsubstantiated stories that Ben burned down someone's barn as an act of vengeance, Will becomes to view Ben as the son he never had, as he is much the same mold. As such, Will does whatever he can to get Ben to be part of the family to carry on the Varner name the way Will wants it be, which means marrying Clara. Through the process, Clara may come to a realization about what she really wants in life, while Jody does whatever he can to retain his position in the family.

Only two survivors are found, Dunbar, and a badly wounded Kendall, the son of a high-profile Joint Chiefs of Staff official. Neither is willing to cooperate with Capt. Julia Osborne's investigation. So base commander Col. Bill Styles calls in ex-Ranger Hardy, an old friend and a persuasive interrogator. Osborne disapproves of Hardy who is on leave from the D.E.A. after having come under suspicion of accepting bribes from local drug traffickers. She is also uneasy when she learns that Hardy once trained under West and hates him almost as passionately as his current recruits. With time running out, Hardy and Osborne call a temporary, if uneasy, truce. Hardy cajoles a confession out of Dunbar, who claims that Sgt. West and the missing Rangers have been murdered and their bodies blown away by the hurricane. When they later interview Kendall, he confirms that the other Rangers and West are dead. But, in almost every other way, his story contradicts Dunbar's. What happened to West and his Ranger team? And what were they really doing out there in the jungle? As each layer reveals more lies and greater deceptions, Hardy and Osborne inch towards the horrible truth about the fate of the missing Rangers.

But it was also the age of Machiavelli, of rampant lawlessness, incessant war, and unspeakable depravity. At the heart of the world order was the Vatican, the arbiter of conflicts between kingdoms and empires. And at the center of the Vatican was a man whose quest for power would propel him to seek the ultimate prize: the Holy See of Rome. He was a man whose name would become synonymous with ruthlessness, and whose reign as Pope would be remembered as the most infamous chapter of the history of the Catholic church: Rodrigo Borgia. His four children--Juan, the oldest, a prideful, lazy, unscrupulous sexual predator; Cesare, a young man torn between a faith that was not his calling and his dark violent nature; Lucretia, a young girl discovering the secret power that a woman's sexuality holds; and Goffredo, an innocent child who would come of age in a family riven by conflict--would provide Rodrigo with a challenge as great as the political maneuvering of his political and religious rivals. This show was a one-hour dramatic series that chronicled the rise to power of this Spanish Cardinal and his clan, who sought to establish a dynasty that held sway over the entire world. Though a man of faith, Rodrigo was also in thrall to the pleasures of the flesh. Not only did he deal with the plotting and conspiracies of his fellow cardinals and the representatives of the great powers, but he was locked in a struggle to contain the bitter sibling rivalries that threatened to tear his family apart. This show was a cauldron of intrigue, violence, murder, lust, politics, faith, incest, betrayal, and redemption--a story as compelling and enlightening as the age in which it took place.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

They are eyeing Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox), nephew to the very formidable, not to mention very rich, local aristocrat Lady Gresham (Dame Maggie Smith), as a prospective match. But when Jane meets the roguish and decidedly non-aristocratic Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy), sparks soon fly along with the sharp repartee. His intellect and arrogance raise her ire, then knock her head over heels. Now, the couple, whose flirtation flies in the face of the sense and sensibility of the age, is faced with a terrible dilemma. If they attempt to marry, they will risk everything that matters - family, friends, and fortune.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life.

A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem, he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin Ayubi. But Baldwin's days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin's vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth.

The animation really isn't that bad considering when it was made. The theme song was catchy and memorable, and I loved singing along to the fun lyrics. The writing is witty, funny and sharp and the story lines are unique and interesting. Yes some moments can be repetitive, but I still enjoyed it regardless, and even as a kid I was so taken with the characters and writing than to care about what material was repeated. The characters are at least engaging, Felix may be annoying to some but not to me, he does have a high pitched voice but he is a funny, likable and endearing character.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

Initial storylines focused on adultery, drug use, frigidity, rape, gossip, homosexuality, marriage problems, racism. The building's ground floor delicatessen run by Hungarian Jew Aldo Godolfus and the nearby laundrette provided central meeting places for characters. Original residents included busty blonde virgin Bev Houghton who fell in love with her neighbour, homosexual lawyer Don Finlayson. Don's flatmate lover was Bruce Taylor, a photographer who was secretly being kept financially by his employer, the bitchy and sardonic Maggie Cameron. Friendly Vera Collins read tarot cards for a living; her husband had deserted her and she would be perpetually unlucky in love. In flat 8 lived immigrants from Lancashire, whining Alf Sutcliffe and his salt of the earth wife Lucy, who worked in the laundrette. Interfering, malaproping gossip Dorrie Evans was the building's self-appointed \"conserge\"; her husband was the more friendly Herb. Lovable rogue and ladies man Jack Sellars romanced Bev, Aldo had the problems of his rebellious daughter Rose before she got married and moved away, and Aldo's new wife Roma Lubinski joined him in his comedy attempts to use modern Australian idiom. Also coming to work at the deli was new resident, the bookish young Arnold Feather. A wine bar opened in the building, run by bubbly Norma Whittaker. She and her amateur inventor husband Les moved in to live in flat 1. Camp young movie fan Dudley Butterfield arrived to work in the wine bar, and Dorrie's old friend and now lodger was the no-nonsense Flo Patterson: a perfect foil for snobbish Dorrie. Maggie Cameron later became part owner of the building, frequently making unsuccessful attempts to evict the residents. The regimented Reg \"Daddy\" McDonald, has dizzy wife Edie \"Mummy\" McDonald and their ebullient daughter Marilyn later moved in the flat 5. An early storyline was the dreaded 'knicker snipper', a devious intruder who ransacked the women's bedrooms and cut holes in their panties and bras. Later comedy storylines were added, while 1974 saw more crime with the horrific panty-hose strangler killing off two young women residents, and attacking one other. 1975 saw four major stars killed off in the infamous bomb-blast episode: a failed attempt to boost the show's by then declining ratings. Australia's first full frontal nude scene was added during the later episodes in 1977 but nevertheless, ratings waned and the series eventually ended, with Dorrie, Herb and Don the only original characters still around at the end.

I gotta say that sometimes the writers just like messing up the ending and stuff but they try the best they can to make the novela the best. What can I say about some of the actors of this soap opera from Venezuela? Well, here is my opinion about them. Let's start off with Miss Valdez: Grettell Valdez had a good performance as Lucia, she is the lead female and the lead male's love interest. Most of the characters of this novela fell in love with this girl as I've seen it in the episodes.Victor Noriega plays the character Raul, he is Lucia's lover, in most of the episodes he starts to distrust her many times due to the problems occurring in their relationship. And he marries Lucia's cousin and worst enemy, who he would never ever love.Osvaldo Rios plays Alejandro Valderrama. This is my favorite character in this novela, he had the best performance and his character is a man who seeks to recover everything he lost and get revenge on his evil mother in law for trying to kill Alejandro's lover, who is none other than her daughter and he accidentally kills the rapist and send to jail for 20 long years.Alba Roversi plays as Lucia's mother and Alejandro's lover, Elena. I loved this actress playing as her, she put a lot of sentimental value in her character. She was the perfect one to play the role of a caring and loving mother. She was amazing.Bernie Paz plays as Claudio Salazar. An excellent doctor and the man who falls for Lucia. But in the end he discovers that she will never love him and he falls for one of her cousins, Mariela.Maritza Rodriguez is the villainous Cristal, she had a lot of dimensional value to this character. Cristal is the ruthless, frivolous and evil one of this novela. She sets her sights on Raul and when she can't seduce him, she had it and she tries to kill him in the end.Lisette Morelos is Natasha. Lucia's cousin and Cristal's sister, she has a good role as a mother too. But sometimes she was kinda sad.Claudia Islas is Enriqueta, Elena's mother, Cristal's grandmother and another villainous character who is always the complice of Cristal. She is also the grandmother of Mariela, Natasha, and Lucia even though she hates her. She is the worst enemy of Alejandro Valderrama.Ariel Lopez Padilla plays as Ernesto, he had a lot of sentimental value too. And also he plays the role of Ernesto's twin brother Romulo. They're twins but they are completely different.Jorge Luis Pila plays as Jose Armando. He sort of reminds me of myself when he fell in love with Lucia but he could never win her love. Like me when I fall in love with someone and sometimes I can't get the girl to be mine. Hehehe! The novela started good but it ended with a thud That is all I can say about it. Thanks!

His famous internationally-renowned pictures of the sixties and seventies were predominantly shot in black and white, contained very long continuous takes and formalist camera-work. Thematically they were pretty much all about the absurdity of war, and specifically the aleatoric justice that war provides.It comes as a shock then to see an incredibly humorous Jancs\u00f3 film, with lots of close-ups and editing, such as The Lord's Lantern in Budapest. One correspondent on this website once described Jancs\u00f3's cinema to me as a glorious cinematic dead-end, this film irrefutably proves the contrary position, Jancso's style is remarkably protean.The reason this film is not well-known in the West (in fact I believe that it has never had a release outside of special screening in the English-speaking world) is due to the fact that although the spirit of the movie is existential and universal, some of the humour is very Hungarian in terms of the references it makes. Apparent jokes about Lajos Kossuth and the also the thirteen martyrs of Arad as well as, I'm sure, several others, were well beyond this viewer.What we have here is a work that is very similar in set-up to a Samuel Beckett play. We have two contemporary, very earthy, very foul-mouthed yet sanguine, gravediggers in a Hungarian cemetery, waiting for life to come their way. This is as close to traditional narrative as we get, the rest is deliberately anti-narrative, as confirmed by the director in his Q &amp; A. Can we tell whether some or all of the characters we see are ghosts, or the scenes we see their fantasies? At several points in the film Miklos himself even appears both with and without Gyula Hern\u00e1di, the writer on most of his major internationally-successful works, both playing themselves, in a playful manner very reminiscent of Robbe-Grillet's brilliant Trans-Europ-Express.The themes are related to modern life. Jancso related to the audience, (and he is quite a raconteur) that the only way he felt he was able to respond to the world any more was to laugh. And indeed how else to respond to an uncohesive world where random acts of violence are commonplace and almost go unnoticed? My country is at war with Iraq, and yet the progress of the war seems to have all the relevance to the daily lives of my countrymen as the result of a favourite quiz show. An example of contemporary nonchalance is provided by the unruffled twenty-something niece of one of the gravediggers, who calmly relates to her uncle at a party how she has just murdered almost her entire immediate family, with all the gravitas of a child bringing home a bad report card, whilst a few metres away an altogether ignored couple are humping away in public as if part of a scene from an Etty painting.You can tell that there is a sort of pagan fondness for dying in this movie, hardly sour or pessimistic in tone, just as if it were a comfortable sleep or a new house you might move in to. That's really the brilliance of this movie, it's kind of like a requiem, or more accurately a solitary ditty for a world that has gone, a world where there was a collective meaning, or a collective purpose, and which is now altogether senseless and fragmented (one of most similar pieces of art I can think of would be the found in the lyrics to the folk song The Miller of Dee which you may find worthwhile to google). In fact from an artistic perspective it is almost a validation that the film has gone unnoticed! It shows a world where you must perhaps make your own sense, where if you are waiting like Godot for sense to come to you, you will be waiting an awful long time.What I've said really describes only a quarter of this wonderful film, to my eyes it was a fragment of heaven reflected through many mirrors. I lack the local knowledge to understand much of the film's purpose, and I have not really touched upon the great humour of the film. One thing I must stress to you is that there are scenes of prolonged shouted profanities, that will make you a little nervous if you are not prepared. There is also a lot of commentary about the politics of power, and perhaps jokes about the influence of the Soviet Union.After the screening Jancs\u00f3 even questioned whether God cared any more about what went on in the world, perhaps there has been a sort of mutual abandonment, a quasi-amicable separation between Him and humanity. On that final point, I'll bid you farewell, if you think you'd enjoy this friendly, yet stylistically-bold film, hopefully your efforts to seek it out will be rewarded.

Success and what goes along with it - fame and money - are arguably foremost on his mind.

He may derail his own success in his reckless behavior, especially falling prey to his urges with adoring young female fans, the most scandalous relationship being with J.W. and his wife Lois' thirteen year old daughter, Myra Gale Brown, who would go on imminently to become Myra Lewis, aka Mrs. Jerry Lee Lewis, and who in part was looking for a protector in her fear during this nuclear age.

Will would not mind Alan so much if he too thought Alan had a bit of a forceful man in him, which he could demonstrate by actually asking Clara to marry him. Conversely, Jody laments that nothing he does is ever good enough for his father, while Clara plain does not like the way he treats them.

Despite Will believing the unsubstantiated stories that Ben burned down someone's barn as an act of vengeance, Will becomes to view Ben as the son he never had, as he is much the same mold. As such, Will does whatever he can to get Ben to be part of the family to carry on the Varner name the way Will wants it be, which means marrying Clara.
